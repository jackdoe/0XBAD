* 0XBAD broadcasty distributed shared memory key/value cache

  the whole thing is horribly simple, using FNV32 hashing to build a table 
  (without collision detection - so if 2 keys collide they are overwritten every time)

  [box A] - 
      my $v = $cache->find($key) || 
              $cache->store_and_broadcast($key,slow_subroutine(),12345);
              
  [box B] - daemon receives the broadcast message, and adds it into the local cache
  [box C] - daemon receives the broadcast message, and adds it into the local cache
  [box D] - udp is lost

  in this case, when a request for $key hits [box D] it will do the same 
  $cache->store_and_broadcast() and rebroadcast the item.

* fixed size
  every item in the cache is with fixed size of KEY_SIZE keysize and BLOB_SIZE value size
  and the shared memory segment is created when you specify exactly how many items between
  2^16 and 2^32 you want to have in the pool.

  my $b = BAD->new(0xBEEF,17); # will create 2^17 items

  this is very ineficient, but for caching small-ish items it works very good.
